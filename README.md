Invasion Extermination is a fun 3rd person shooter Unity game where player fights against the alien invasion.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In terms of running the project on Unity development environment, it is required to download Unity Hub and Unity please refer to the section *Built With* to know what version.

### Installing

To run the game for Sprint 1:
```
1. Download the project files
2. Once downloaded, navigate to folder "SPRINT 1 APPLICATION"
3. Within the folder there is a Invasion_Extermination.exe that can be run to start the built game
```

3. Proceed to run PlayMode or EditMode depending on if they are PlayMode or EditMode tests.
```

Note: Tests run as normal tests NUnit Test Runner with the [Test] and with the [UnityTest] tests allows test to skip frame.

### And coding style tests

TDD (Test Driven Development) procedure was followed to create a unit test for each user story (Has a git hub tag for end and start of user story) before starting the coding. The unit tests test the functionality of each user story and make sure that they work.

Unit tests in Unity are executed using Unity Testing Framework which uses a integration of the [NUnit Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-nunit).
